Org roles and permissions
====================================================================

There are three roles in an Org:

Owner: Users who manage Org members and billing.
Admin: Users who manage team membership and package access.
Member: Users who create and publish packages in the Org scope.
On the public registry, you cannot remove the last owner from an Org. To delete an Org, contact npm Support.

npm Enterprise users: If you are using npm Enterprise, deactivating the only owner of an Org will cause that Org to be ownerless. If you have deactivated the last owner of an Org on an npm Enterprise instance, contact npm Enterprise Support at enterprise@npmjs.com
