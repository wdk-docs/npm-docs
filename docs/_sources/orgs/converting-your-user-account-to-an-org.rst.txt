Converting your user account to an Org
=====================================================================================================

If you have an npm user account, you can convert your user account to an Org. When you convert your user account to an Org, we will:

Create a new Org with the name of your user account.
Prompt you to create a new npm user account. We recommend choosing a variation of your old user name so collaborators will recognize you. For example, if your old username was “wombat”, your new username might be “wombat-new”.
Make your your new npm user account an owner of your new Org.
Add your new npm user account to a team called “Developers” in your new Org.
Transfer packages owned by your user account to your new Org.
Transfer your existing Org and team memberships and contributor access settings to your new user account.
Note: Once your old user account has been converted to an Org, you will no longer be able to sign in to npm with your old user account.
