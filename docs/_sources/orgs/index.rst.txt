Orgs
============

npm Orgs allow teams of contributors to read, write, and publish public or private scoped packages, as well as unscoped public packages governed by the Org.

Orgs are free for public packages, and cost $7 per member per month for private packages. For more information on Orgs pricing, see our pricing page.
