Creating and publishing unscoped public packages
====================================================

Note: You can only publish unscoped packages to the npm public registry. You cannot publish unscoped packages to an npm Enterprise registry.
As an npm user, you can create unscoped packages to use in your own projects and publish them to the npm public registry for others to use in theirs. Unscoped packages are always public and are referred to by the package name only:

package-name

For more information on package scope, access, and visibility, see “Package scope, access level, and visibility”.

Note: Before you can publish public unscoped npm packages, you must sign up for an npm user account.

Creating an unscoped public package
-------------------------------------------------------

Note: You can only publish unscoped packages to the npm public registry. You cannot publish unscoped packages to an npm Enterprise registry.
On the command line, create a directory for your package:
 mkdir my-test-package
Navigate to the root directory of your package:
 cd my-test-package
If you are using git to manage your package code, in the package root directory, run the following commands, replacing git-remote-url with the git remote URL for your package:
 git init
 git remote add origin git://git-remote-url
In the package root directory, run the npm init command.
Respond to the prompts to generate a package.json file. For help naming your package, see “Package name guidelines”.
Create a README file that explains what your package code is and how to use it.
In your preferred text editor, write the code for your package.

Reviewing package contents for sensitive or unnecessary information
-------------------------------------------------------

Publishing sensitive information to the registry can harm your users, compromise your development infrastructure, be expensive to fix, and put you at risk of legal action. We strongly recommend removing sensitive information, such as private keys, passwords, personally identifiable information (PII), and credit card data before publishing your package to the registry.

For less sensitive information, such as testing data, use a .npmignore or .gitignore file to prevent publishing to the registry. For more information, see this article.

Publishing unscoped public packages
-------------------------------------------------------

On the command line, navigate to the root directory of your package.
 cd /path/to/package
To publish your public package to the npm registry, run:
 npm publish
To see your public package page, visit https://npmjs.com/package/package-name, replacing package-name with the name of your package. Public packages will say public below the package name on the npm website.
For more information on the publish command, see the CLI documentation.
