Package name guidelines
==============================

When choosing a name for your package, choose a name that

is unique
is descriptive
meets npm policy guidelines. For example, do not give your package an offensive name, and do not use someone elseâ€™s trademarked name or violate the npm trademark policy.
Additionally, when choosing a name for an unscoped package, also choose a name that

is not already owned by someone else
is not spelled in a similar way to another package name
will not confuse others about authorship
