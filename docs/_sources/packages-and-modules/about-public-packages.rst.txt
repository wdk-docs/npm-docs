About public packages
==============================

As an npm user or Org member, you can create and publish public packages that anyone can download and use in their own projects.

- **Unscoped** public packages exist in the global public registry namespace and can be referenced in a **package.json** file with the package name alone: **package-name**.
- **Scoped** public packages belong to a user or Org and must be preceded by the user or Org name when included as a dependency in a **package.json** file:

   - **@username/package-name**
   - **@org-name/package-name**
