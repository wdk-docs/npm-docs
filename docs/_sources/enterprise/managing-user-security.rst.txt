Managing user security
=============================================

To keep your npm Enterprise instance secure, as an Enterprise instance admin, you should:

Limit the number of additional Enterprise admins on your instance.
Deactivate users who no longer need access to your npm Enterprise instance (such as users who have left the company) as quickly as possible.
Users of your npm Enterprise instance should:

Enable 2FA on their Enterprise instance accounts.
Use read-only tokens to delegate access to private packages to other tools in their workflow.
