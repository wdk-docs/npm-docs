Demoting an admin to a non-admin user
==============================================================================

.. note:: Demoting an admin does not deactivate them. To deactivate a user, follow the steps in "Viewing, deactivating, and reactivating users".
If an admin on your npm Enterprise instance no longer needs to take admin actions on the instance (e.g. configuring SSO, activating and deactivating users, or inviting users to the instance), as an Enterprise instance admin, you can demote the admin to a non-admin user.

If you havenâ€™t already, add the user to your instance, either by having them sign in with your SSO provider, or by inviting them to create a username and password on the instance.
Have an Enterprise admin contact npm Enterprise Support at enterprise@npmjs.com with the name of the admin to be demoted to a non-admin user.
