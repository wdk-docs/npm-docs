Permanently deleting a user
==============================================================================

As an npm Enterprise admin, you can contact npm Enterprise Support at enterprise@npmjs.com to completely remove a user from your Enterprise instance if they will never need to access the instance again.

Note: When permanently deleting a user, you will work with npm support to make sure any Orgs and packages they own are transferred to other users on your Enterprise instance.
