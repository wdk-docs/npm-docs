If there’s no available semver range (i.e. you’re running npm outdated --global, or the package isn’t included in package.json), then wanted shows the currently-installed version. latest is the version of the package tagged as latest in the registry. Running npm publish with no special configuration will publish the package with a dist-tag of latest. This may or may not be the maximum version of the package, or the most-recently published version of the package, depending on how the package’s developer manages the latest dist-tag. location is where in the dependency tree the package is located. Note that npm outdated defaults to a depth of 0, so unless you override that, you’ll always be seeing only top-level dependencies that are outdated. package type (when using --long / -l) tells you whether this package is a dependency or a devDependency. Packages not included in package.json are always marked dependencies. homepage (when using --long / -l) is the homepage value contained in the package’s package.json Red means there’s a newer version matching your semver requirements, so you should update now. Yellow indicates that there’s a newer version above your semver requirements (usually new major, or new 0.x minor) so proceed with caution.
