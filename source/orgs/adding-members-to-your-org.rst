Adding members to your Org
=====================================================================================================

As an Org owner, you can add other npm users to your Org to give them read or read and write access to public and private packages within your Org’s scope, as well as public unscoped packages governed by your Org.

npm Enterprise users: Make sure new users have been added to your enterprise instance before inviting them to an Org within the instance.
When you add a member to your Org, they are sent an email inviting them to the Org.

Once the new member accepts the invitation, they are:

assigned the role of “member”
added to the “developers” team
If you have a paid Org, you will be billed $7 per month for each new member.
