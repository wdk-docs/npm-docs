.. _shrinkwrap.json:

npm-shrinkwrap.json
===================================

A publishable lockfile
DESCRIPTION
npm-shrinkwrap.json is a file created by npm-shrinkwrap. It is identical to package-lock.json, with one major caveat: Unlike package-lock.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json may be included when publishing a package.

The recommended use-case for npm-shrinkwrap.json is applications deployed through the publishing process on the registry: for example, daemons and command-line tools intended as global installs or devDependencies. Itâ€™s strongly discouraged for library authors to publish this file, since that would prevent end users from having control over transitive dependency updates.

Additionally, if both package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json are present in a package root, package-lock.json will be ignored in favor of this file.

For full details and description of the npm-shrinkwrap.json file format, refer to the manual page for package-lock.json.
