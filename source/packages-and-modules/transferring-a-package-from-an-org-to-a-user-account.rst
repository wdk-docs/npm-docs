Transferring a package from an Org to a user account
===========================================================================================

You may also want to move a package out of an Org to a user account. For example, if you no longer want the package to be controlled by an Org, and would like to transfer it to a user.

If a package has been added to an Org team, adding a collaborator using the package admin tab or the owner CLI command will result in a team not found error.

In this case, you wonâ€™t be able to add a collaborator, then remove the package from a team.

If you need to transfer a package from an Org to a user account, contact npm Support.
