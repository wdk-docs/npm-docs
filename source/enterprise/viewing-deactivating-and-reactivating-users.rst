As an Enterprise admin, you can view active and inactive users, deactivate users who no longer need access to your npm Enterprise instance (such as users who have left your company), and reactivate inactive users.

Deactivating users§
As an npm Enterprise admin, you can deactivate users who no longer need access to your npm Enterprise instance – for example, users who have left the company or whose responsibilities have changed.

Deactivating a user will invalidate their login tokens, but will not delete Orgs or packages they owned. A deactivated user will remain visible in the “Manage users” panel and can be reactivated by an admin user.
