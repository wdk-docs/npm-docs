Getting started with npm Enterprise
=======================================

As an npm Enterprise admin, once you have created a temporary username and password from the signup link for your new instance, you should:

Log in to your npm Enterprise instance.
Configure SSO authentication
Link your account to your SSO provider.
Create one or more Orgs.
Tell users to log in to the instance with their SSO credentials.
Add users to Orgs and teams.
Have users follow the steps in the “Getting started” and “Packages and modules” documentation to download Node.js and npm, configure their npm client, and publish and install packages.
